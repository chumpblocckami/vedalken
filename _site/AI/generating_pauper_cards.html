<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Generative AI (GenAI) is a type of Artificial Intelligence that can create a wide variety of data, such as images,
videos, audio, text, and 3D models. It does this by learning patterns from existing data, then using this knowledge to
generate new and unique outputs. GenAI is capable of producing highly realistic and complex content that mimics human
creativity, and in recent years it is used to fasten the human process of generating content. This specific kind of
Artificial Intelligence lately has
raised an enormous public interest, both for its possible applicability and its controversies. In this post I’ll
jump on the AIGeneration train and use it for creating custom, never seen and totally plausible Magic the Gathering
cards.</p>

<h1 id="approach">Approach</h1>

<p>Which are the attributes that compose a Magic the Gathering card?
<img src="./../assets/images/layout_mtg_explained.png" alt="layout" /></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Title</strong> defines the name of the card</li>
  <li><strong>CMC</strong> defines the mana cost of the card; in the most common cases, it’s composed by a number, which refers to the
colorless mana, and a mana symbol, which defines the colored mana needed to cast the spells. Sometimes the mana cost
can have strange variations, such
has <a href="https://cards.scryfall.io/png/front/f/f/ffd079d8-b191-4f54-bb04-427b3736f745.png?1562949161">hybrid mana costs</a>,
<a href="https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/9/9/995486ce-58bb-4753-a812-0ca73ef1a235.jpg?1562880052">Pyrexian mana cost</a>
or
even <a href="https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/0/1/0186a93c-000a-4b8f-983d-e1471185dc1f.jpg?1562492051">no mana cost</a>!</li>
  <li><strong>Artwork</strong> defines the image of the card, it occupies the most space on the card.</li>
  <li><strong>Type</strong> defines the type of the card: most of the cards belongs to supertype such as Creature, Sorcery, Enchantment,
Artifact, Land or Planeswalker, but multiple others were forged.</li>
  <li><strong>Symbol</strong> defines the symbol of the edition and the rarity of the card based on irs color (black for common, silver
for uncommon, gold for rare and magenta for mythic rare).</li>
  <li><strong>Text</strong> defines the ability of the card: it can
be <a href="https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/3/d/3d09a0c7-3934-4bf3-a56a-5b670b168eee.jpg?1559593430">non existent</a>, <a href="https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/8/f/8f973d6b-4a34-4b0e-b092-ead05bf2e535.jpg?1562762506">
almost
non-existent</a> or
<a href="https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/e/4/e41cf82d-3213-47ce-a015-6e51a8b07e4f.jpg?1572490640">very long</a>. The card
may describe the in-game characteristic of the card and/or the lore of it.</li>
  <li><strong>Power/Toughness (P/T)</strong> are characteristics unique to creatures that defines how much damage the creature deal and
how much damage the creature can suffer before being send to the graveyard.</li>
</ol>

<p>In this blogpost, I’m going to briefly describe how generate all the aforementioned characteristic of a card using AI.
In this application, we’re going to use an ensamble approch, using two models in order to render the card: ChatGPT for
generating all the attributes of the card, and StableDiffusion for generating the artwork. As for the layout, we used a
blank one that we’re updating with the generations.</p>

<h3 id="bonus-whats-chatgpt">Bonus: what’s ChatGPT?</h3>

<p>ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot developed by OpenAI and released in November 2022. It is built on
top of OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 families of large language models (LLMs) and has been fine-tuned (an approach to
transfer learning) using both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.
ChatGPT is a member of the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) family of language models.
The fine-tuning process leveraged both supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning in a process called
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Both approaches use human trainers to improve the model’s
performance. In the case of supervised learning, the model was provided with conversations in which the trainers played
both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning step, human trainers first ranked responses
that the model had created in a previous conversation. These rankings were used to create “reward models” that were
used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
ChatGPT’s training data includes man pages and information about internet
phenomena such as memes, programming languages such as bulletin board systems and community discussion about multiple
arguments strictly related to the web.</p>

<p>Although the core function of a chatbot is to mimic a human conversationalist, ChatGPT is versatile. It can write and
debug computer programs, write business pitches, compose music,
fairy tales and student essays, answer test questions (sometimes, depending on the test, at a level above the average
human test-taker), write poetry and song lyrics, and, as demonstrate in this brief blogpost, generating Magic the
Gathering cards.</p>

<h3 id="bonus-whats-stable-diffusion">Bonus: what’s Stable Diffusion?</h3>

<p>Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, text-to-image model released in 2022. It is primarily used to generate detailed
images conditioned on text descriptions, though it can also be applied to other tasks such as inpainting, outpainting,
and generating image-to-image translations guided by a text prompt. It was developed by the start-up Stability AI in
collaboration with a number of academic researchers and non-profit organizations.</p>

<p>Stable Diffusion is a latent diffusion model, a kind of deep generative neural network. Its code and model weights have
been released publicly, and it can run on most consumer hardware equipped with a modest GPU.</p>

<p>Stable Diffusion uses a kind of diffusion model (DM), called a latent diffusion model (LDM) developed by the CompVis
group at LMU Munich. Introduced in 2015, diffusion models are trained with the objective of removing successive
applications of Gaussian noise on training images which can be thought of as a sequence of denoising autoencoders.
Stable Diffusion consists of 3 parts: the variational autoencoder (VAE), U-Net, and an optional text encoder. The
VAE encoder compresses the image from pixel space to a smaller dimensional latent space, capturing a more fundamental
semantic meaning of the image. Gaussian noise is iteratively applied to the compressed latent representation during
forward diffusion. The U-Net block, composed of a ResNet backbone, denoises the output from forward diffusion
backwards to obtain a latent representation. Finally, the VAE decoder generates the final image by converting the
representation back into pixel space. The denoising step can be flexibly conditioned on a string of text, an image,
or another modality. The encoded conditioning data is exposed to denoising U-Nets via a cross-attention mechanism.
For conditioning on text, the fixed, pretrained CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder is used to transform text prompts to an
embedding space. Researchers point to increased computational efficiency for training and generation as an advantage
of LDMs.</p>

<p>Stable Diffusion was trained on pairs of images and captions taken from LAION-5B, a publicly available dataset derived
from Common Crawl data scraped from the web, where 5 billion image-text pairs were classified based on language and
filtered into separate datasets by resolution, a predicted likelihood of containing a watermark, and predicted “
aesthetic” score (e.g. subjective visual quality).</p>

<p>The text to image sampling script within Stable Diffusion, known as “text2img”, consumes a text prompt in addition to
assorted option parameters covering sampling types, output image dimensions, and seed values. The script outputs an
image file based on the model’s interpretation of the prompt. Generated images are tagged with an invisible digital
watermark to allow users to identify an image as generated by Stable Diffusion, although this watermark loses its
efficacy if the image is resized or rotated</p>

<h1 id="code">Code</h1>

<p>Here I’ll quickly describe the main parts of the process with a brief description of the approaches used:</p>

<h3 id="attribute-generation">Attribute generation</h3>

<p>The card’s attribute are generated using ChatGPT queried with a very specific system prompt, asking the design of cards
with very strict rules and defining all the requirements. In conjunction, an example card’s structure is passed to the
model.
Then, another prompt is declared, that defines the domain of the card generation: in this case, I’ll decide to use Harry
Potter.</p>

<p><img src="./../assets/images/chatgpt.png" alt="ChatGPT main points" /></p>

<h3 id="artwork-generation">Artwork generation</h3>

<p>The card’s artwork is generated simply using the card’s title; more complex approaches can be used, for example using a
more detailed prompt.</p>

<p><img src="./../assets/images/stable_diffusion.png" alt="StableDiffusion main points" /></p>

<h3 id="layout-generation">Layout generation</h3>

<p>Layout generation is as simple as it is: it has been used a blank card layout, where all the attributes are hot encoded
inside. This method, which is very fast, is also very error-prone, but i wanted to be more focused on the AI part
instead of this one.

<h3 id="final-result">Final Result</h3>

<p>Card generated are totally fine and more or less follows the plot of the first books.</p>

a <a href="">Huggingface Space</a>; as mentioned, in
order
to run the code and generate cards, you need to have a OpenAI token. ChatGPT is offered as a pay-per-use service, so
<strong>every generation costs</strong>: the price is by no mean expensive, but it’s a good thing to have in mind while playing with

<p>While wandering across <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, I stumbled across <a href="https://twitter.com/minimaxir">@minimaxir</a> work
on exploring ChatGPT API, and while inspecting <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/chatgpt_api_test">his code</a>, I came up with
the idea for this blogpost.
Big thanks especially
for his context and prompt engineering; without his repository, I would be in trouble, since I have little to no
experience in it.</p>
