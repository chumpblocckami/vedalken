Difference between paper Pauper league - MTGO Pauper league
- Difference in scope: deck with cards i own / decks with less maneaouver (shuffle effects) / metagame 
- Hidden results from 5-0 
- Challenges top8 are not reflective of any meta
- Infinite strategies / loop-based strategies / click intensive strategies
- Grinder mentality (5-0 lavadora) vs. player mentality 
- High skilled player with an archetype will be rewarded in the single shot tournament instead of the endless grind of leagues
- Few 'pro players' on Twitter leverage the sentiment towards the meta
- Not every meta is bad (Ragavan/Monastery roulette)
- Play with the limitation, not with what if (for example, if you can't play Initiative, play other things)
- Play environment are key to the success of a match (for example, sitting on the sofa watching tv is worst than play sit on a tournament table)
-
