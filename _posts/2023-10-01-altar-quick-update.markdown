## Introduction

After quite some time I finally had time to play some pauper both online and irl, piloting my beloved Altar Tron, which
I didn't play much since Paupergeddon Florence.
I didn't grind a lot, because I played only a paper tournament, three LPTAA leagues and a bunch of MTGO leagues, but all
of them were after the release of Commander Masters, which shook the format introducing new and busted cards that I
didn't have time to face yet.
New decks emerged from the aforementioned releases: the most notable ones are UW Artifacts, MonoR Sticker and monoU
terror, all of them gaining some powerful cards (that none asked for).
After facing multiple times these decks, I have visualized how Altar Tron is positioned, and I
wanted to write a quick update for write down some thoughts.

**Spoiler**: No good news :(

## The Meta

Now the meta seems to be warped around few decks, which are:

1. MonoR Sticker
2. UW Glitters
3. MonoU/UB Terrors
4. Caw Gates

Obviously there are others contenders, such as RG Ponza, Boros Synth and BG Gardens, and depeding on where you play (
local leagues, irl tournaments, online), the meta change.

That being said, I faced multiple times these 'new' decks, and this is the conclusions I came up with:

- **UW Glitter**: This match up is highly unfavored, I didn't win a single game against this archetype and the only
  matches I was able to take down were non-game where he didn't draw nothing relevant and I quickly assemble tron + the
  combo. This match up concludes when ATG connects, no matter your plays.
  **Record**: 1-4

- **MonoR Kuldotha**: '_____ Goblin' gives the deck another busted opening, where a T3 goblin into whatever is just a
  match lost. MonoR historically was a 50/50 match up, but the addition of card draw and this ritual boi strengthrn the
  match up on monoR side. Altar now lose on average to t1 Swiftspear + multiple spells, t3 ____ Goblin + whatever and/or
  combinations of these.
  **Record**: 2-5

- **Terror**: Cryptic Serpent is just a better Gurmag Angler, so the deck plays a more lean plan. Easier to play 5/5,
  better manabase and Delver of secrets lead to more problematic games. T1 delver + interaction is probably enough to
  win most of the games, and also fast 5/5 with protections are just unwinnable. One thing I noticed is that the match
  up is also influenced by the skill of the player: the more skilled is the player, the more Altar tron struggle to win.
  **Record**: 5-3

These three, most dominant decks rn, have strategies that are better, leaner and faster than Altar Tron plan: this is no
good news.

### TLDR:

| Decks          | Main strategy         | Average turn kill | Sideboard                           | How to beat them                         | 
|----------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| MonoR Kuldotha | Combat + spell damage | 3-4               | Artifact hate, occasionally gy hate | Fast tron + Weather + opponent bad draws |
| UW Glitters    | Combat                | 3-4               | Counter, occasionally artifact hate | Fast tron            + no Glitter        |
| Terror         | Combat                | 5-7               | Counter                             | Fast tron + draw spell                   |

| Type of tournaments | Win | Lose | Total | Win percentage |
|---------------------|-----|------|-------|----------------|
| IPT Leagues         | 7   | 8    | 15    | 46%            |
| MTGO leagues        | 13  | 12   | 25    | 50%            | 
| Radioatog team trio | 2   | 3    | 5     | 40%            | 

Results aren't stellar: on the time period of Paupergeddon Milan (one moth prior - one month after), I was on something
lie 68% win rate combined paper and online.

## The deck

![the deck](./../../../assets/woe_update/the_list.png)

> The list I'm currently playing

My maindeck idea is to play it full combo, playing cards that tries to make fast Tron and assemble the combo as fast as
possible.

Some card discussion:

- **Candy Trail**: At first glance I had big hopes on this card, and I played it a lot in my lists: it helps you to
  assemble tron and find good cards, but most of the time is more or less an updated version of 'Introduction to
  Prophecy'.

- **Rowan Grim's Search**: It's the best option for make value and digging for combo pieces, it has a good synergy with
  Moments Peace and Myr Retriver and helps in the grindy match ups. It's bigger weakness is that without bargain, is not
  such a great card. I was very reluctant to play it but a very good player friends of mine states that 'It's
  essentially Dig Through Time of pauper', which convinced me instantly (not fully yet).

The sideboard is mainly composed by cards that lets you survive the early turns.
Gigadrowse + Wizard's Rocket is my wet dream and can be used to comboing off over multiple counterspells: I chose this
set up because I think there isn't space for a full set of Duress.
Sideboarding is more or less the one described in my previous article of Altar Tron.

## Wrap up

In conclusion, the new deck that emerges from the latest expansions are all bad match ups for Altar Tron, which puts the
deck in a worst spot than in the previous meta.

Is the deck still viable? I really don't know, since it continues to put good tournament placement both in irl
tournaments and in LPI leagues in contrast of my paper and online results.
Probably I'm not on the the optimal list route, but I'm refusing to play a deck with only 2 Altar in a 'go fast or die'
meta and/or with a full set of a Rowan Grim Search where, most of the time, on T3 you are on the verge of dying (if not
just dead)

The only hope is to have the metagame evolve on the midrange path, where decks get slower and more grindier for be
better prepared in the later turns and sideboards increasingly aquire more Red elemental blast / Blue elemental blast in
favor of artifact removal and/or gy hate.

My brain says that Altar Tron is not a viable deck anymore, but my heart tell me to still put works in it, both for the
love for the deck and the fact that I don't know how to play others decks :).

My advice?

**Keep touching pallette (small artifact balls made of steel that cycle for a small amount of invested mana).**
