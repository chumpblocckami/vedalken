## Introduction

Paupergeddon Lecco, which took place 26 March 2023, was the biggest Pauper Tournament ever registered, with 600+ players
from all over Europe attending the event; the day featured a 10 round swiss with a top8 cut.
The tournament started at 9.30 AM: the swiss finished approximately ad 23 PM, and the last card in the final was
slinghed at 2 AM.
I was good and lucky enough to be the last man standing, completed the swiss with a record of 8-1-1, and i was declared
winner after another 3 rounds in the top8. For clarity, we split top4 (prizes after splitting where something near 1.3k
in MKM coupon, 3 Secret Lairs and some goodies) but we decide to play for the declaring the winner.
In this brief blogpost, i'll cover some points about the deck I played, Altar Tron, including deck building choices,
match up analysis, sideboard strategies, and then I quickly describe how the tournament rolled out, which archetypes I
faced and how the games unveils throughout the tournament.

## History

The archetype made is timid debut right after the unified pauper announcement, where paper common and mtgo common where
made playable for both the play modes, making one large shared card pool.
The new additions, such as Ashnod Altar, ignite some interest in deckbuilders all over the community, but it took some
time and mtgo tix to actually make the deck work.
The idea of the deck is simple: deploy a large amount of 3/3 golems from Golem Foundry thanks to the big amount of
triggers made possible from 2 Myr Retriever and Ashnod's Altar.
The first approaches get ideas from another combo Tron Builds, Eggs Tron, which also play a combo plan with Golem
Foundry, but it differs from the strategy; the first lists were based on midrange strategies, where the goal was to
survive and draw as many cards as possible.
In this early stage of development, two players stands among other for they
brews: [Saidin Raken](https://twitter.com/jakeals), who tirelessly tried the deck on MTGO, and Giorgio Venditti, aka
GiorgioCombo, a player from Italy that had great success with the deck in national paper tournament.
The lists relied heavily on Fangren Marauder or Mystical Teachings package, and they went for the midrange/control
journey for assembling the combo: at that time, the meta were slower, and only 4 copies of the myr were avaialable,
making the combo not particularly fast, so the strategy was based around drawing cards and survive thanks to
Weather the Storm and Fangren Marauder, since the deck features lots of cheap and expendable artifacts.
After finding GiorgioCombo decklist, i played his sixties and i had moderate success with that strategy, letting me
Top16 Paupergeddon Pisa with a [list](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/4930842) that represent the afromentioned
strategy. From there, nothing really has changed, and the new lists that on and off appears online were no different in
the core but different from the support cards, ranging from less or more card draw, more or less utilities or metagame
cards. The turning point for the archetype starts with the spoiler
of [Myr Kinsmith](https://scryfall.com/card/one/236/myr-kinsmith), a card that a first sight don't say much, since it's
an highly cost tutor for a very specific tribe that don't have much fortune in Pauper, but it quickly became another key
point of the deck, since it has the ability to tutor Myr Retriever, which is a key part of the combo, really fasten the
deck. With this new addition, the deck can drop the midrangy strat of drawing cards for eventually assemble the combo,
and start to have a more combo-oriented settings, where its focus was shifted from '**survive as long as possible**'
to '**kill as fast as i can**'

## Main

As introduced before, my deck's choice was Altar Tron, which is a combo deck, based on the infamous Urza's Land that
features Ashnod's
Altar + Myr Retriever synergy to make a large amount of artifacts etb, a tremendous number of spells casted, an infinite
death triggers and so on. I chose this deck because i really like combo decks (if you want to play Aggro, play
Heartstone) and i love artifacts, and this deck features both: I also thought that the deck was a meta sleeper, since
on MTGO don't see a lots of play for time constraints and in-game click intensity.

I choose to build the deck based on well-defined pillars:

1. _The build must be combo-centric_: I was sure that the midrange strategy of the deck wasn't optimized, and i tried to
   create a deck that was full combo plan (example:. Myr Kinsmith > Mystical Teachings);


2. _Play cards that are good despite opponent's deck or turn drawn_: I opted to play cards that are weaker in power but
   are good every time they are drawn and in every occations, discarding card that are better but in very narrow or
   paritcular spots (example: Ancient Stirrings > Faithless Loothing );


3. _Do not try to beat sideboard strategy maindeck_: I opted to not include cards that are good vs. strategy that often
   comes in after sideboard (es. graveyard hate), both for having leaner draws and also relax the deckbuilding
   decisions (example: Blood Fountain).


4. _Minimize the use of colored cards maindeck_: The combo is almost colorless, so the base has to be at most colorelss:
   support card that are colored has to be too good to not be included. (example: Deadly Dispute > Scrapwork Mutt >
   Reckoner's Bargain)


5. _Tron lands has to be 8th or 9th edition_: BASED. (example: old layout Tron lands are not elegant);


6. _Don't try to win against every archetype and normalize losing, but always have a plan_: for this part i'll borrow
   the words from a Bryant Cook tweets, that sum ups perfectly my thought:
   ![Can't beat anything](./../assets/images/cant_beat_anythin.jpeg)


With the aforementioned statements in mind, let's see the decklist I came up with:
![The Main](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FsLrghCWAAAM94t?format=jpg&name=large)

Below a brief description of card choice:

**Combo part**:

> 4 Myr Retriever 4 Ashnod's Altar

Here we have the combo package of the deck: since the deck aims to find all the combo pieces as fast as possible, it
features
the full set of everyone. There are few arguments about the fourth Altar, but after extensive testing i realized that
the Ashno'd
artifact is way more useful than any other sport card, so i went for the fourth copy.

**Finisher**:

> 3 Weather the Storm 4 Golem Foundry

The wincon are an endless army of 3/3 golem or infinite life: this lets us close the game against the 95% of the meta,
because the vast majority of the decks in the meta wins by combat, so an unlimited amount of blockers and a lot of
lifepoints
are enough to win on the turn after comboing off; there's no same-turn finisher cards such as Makeshift Munitions or
Impact Tremors,
since the deck that can survive to this combo are few and not so popular.

**Draw**:

> 4 Deadly Dispute 3 Ichor Wellspring

As draw engine we have the well know synergy between Ichor Wellspring and Deadly Dispute, that, as for now, is the best
way
to draw cards in pauper. In the early list, i didn't play this draw engine, but i relied on Scrapyard Mutt and Clockwork
Fox,
that were better combined with Ashnod's Altar, but weaker on their own. I quickly changed my mind since i realized that
there's no
better alternative than DD on wellspring.

**Tutors**:

> 4 Expedition Map 4 Ancient Stirrings 3 Myr Kinsmith

These cards make the deck very consistent, allowing a fast tron assemble and multiple ways to find the combo pieces.
This card
are the core of the deck, and let the deck be very consistent.

**Support**:

> 4 Chromatic Star 4 Chromatic Sphere 2 Energy Refractor

These cards help us to filter mana in order to play colored spells. I started with playing only the 8 chromatic
artifact,
but i quickly realize that i want at least 10 colored ways to make colored mana, so added 2 Energy Refractor for making
the deck more consistent.

**Lands**:

> 4 Urza's Tower 4 Urza's Power Plant 4 Urza's Mine 2 Shimmering Grotto 1 Forest

This is as straight as it appears: 12 Urzalands, 2 Grotto for colored mana, and a single basic for fightning a possible
Cleasing Wildfire.

**Utility Lands**:

> 1 Haunted Fengranf 1 Polluted Mire

These are lands that are tutored using Expedition Map when Tron is assembled and Shimmering Grotto is already fetched:
Polluted
Mire is great for cycling a card off the map, and the fengranf is literally a tutorable spell that lets you make value
off a
creature in the graveyard and also helps you fightning graveyard hate at istant speed.

As for the maindeck, i think that there's no room for improving: the slots for adding new card is very tight if not
close, since
all the pieces are well combined to others, and removing a single card will weaken others or also the entire strategies.
The idea of the deck is to have cards that are good in any moment of the game: from turn1 to turn10, we need to good
draws,
so i prefer to avoid spike cards that are good only in certain match up or in certain spot. With this idea in mind, the
deck
kind of build itself alone: with 17 lands, 10 cards for filtering mana, 15 cards that lets us combo, 11 tutors and 7
draw spell,
there's no spot for other cards. We can replace some cards.

### Bonus: Single card discussion:

- **Crop Rotation**

In the first drafts i played 2 Crop Rotation instead of Energy Refractor, but i quickly realize that the colored mana
were too important, and crop was great in assembling tron, but bad after tron was assembled, despite its good synergy
with
Haunted Fengranf. I thought about cutting map for crop, since they aim to the same purpose, but Expedition Map is easier
to cast,
better in late game since it can tutor up better things, and it also enable the strongest starting hand with less
cards (
two different tron lands + map vs two different tron lands + crop + green source). At the end, i had to make a choice,
and
assuming that i had to cut one of the tutors for crop, i analyzed proes and cons of every cards, resulting in the table:

|                           | Expedition Map | Crop Rotation         | Ancient Stirrings |
---------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Deckbuilding requirements | -              | at least 18 lands     | -                 |
| Casting                   | -              | Colored mana          | Colored Mana      |
| Best scenario             | 2 urza's       | 2 urza's, land, color | Colorless in top5 |

- **Makeshift Munitions**

In early draft, i played Makeshift Munitions as a 1 ofs for being able to win on the spot vs. decks that fog locks or
decks
that can burn you out to death if you assemble the infinite golem combo instead of infinite life. I quickly realized
that
lots of my victory didn't depend on munitions, so i cut it in favor of other cards that fits better in the strategy, and
i
add the red enchantment as a sidebord card. This choice was strenghten by the fact that i dont run the full set of
Ichor, which
is in a good synergy with it, and the fact that it, in this type of deck, fit the only role of finisher, since the
midrange plan is
dropped, so action like sacrifice a myr with munitions to make a point of damage and returning another myr retriever
won't happen often,
since in that spot you likely to have combo. Munitions also don't shine vs. faeries or other decks with small creature,
since the
primary function of our artifact is to filter color, and not being launched to opponent's creatures.

- **Blood Fountain**

From the day1, i've not been a fan of the black artifact, since it requires a lot of effort and a particulary board
state to make it
good: most of the time, it's a 1B cards that discards one and draw one, and that's not very appealing. In the previous
build, where
the plan was to be the value/midrange deck, the one mana artifact was a nice addition, but to me can be replaced with
more impactful
card, such as Myr Kinsmith or combo pieces. Responding to the argument that is a good way to beat graveyard hate g1,
it's true, but
Haunted Fengranf fits this role better, since it take a land slot which is open, and it's tutorable with Expedition Map,
makes it
better drawn in later turns. Responding to the argument that Blood Fountain can draws you the deck combined with Energy
Refractor when
comboing off, it's true, but very unlikely: i eun two copies of the filter artifact, and also with this list that is
focused on
assembling the combo as fast as it can, the full combo with Foundry is not always found, so having all the 7 pieces to
draw the deck
is very hard and unlikely. In a build with the full set of Energy Refractor, Makeshift Munitions and full set of all the
combo pieces,
can be a good addition, but good luck fit everything in a 60 cards deck.

- **Faithless Looting**

Faithless Loothing is just a worst version of Ancient Stirrings: the discard clause is very bad for this build, since
you
don't have a number of cards that are better in the graveyard than in hand, and also with a low land count you'll
probably
find yourself discarding spell that somehow you want to cast. In previous build with Mystical Teachings or Conjurer's
Bauble,
i can see an weak argument in playing some copies of this spell, but it's hard to justify a slot for this card.

- **Reckoner's Bargain**

Reckoner's Bargain is taking the 5-6th slots of Deadly Dispute, but more sacrifice clause requires more cheap
artifact to sacrifice,
and more colored spell required more colored fixing/mana source: stated all this requirements, to me is not optimal
to play
a weaker version of Deadly Dispute that also requires some other structural fixes, so i'll end up cutting the black
draw engine.

- **Foundry Inspector**

This card doesn't fit well in the deck since it don't add density or depth, since don't solve a particular problem
that the
deck is facing or other similar issue, it's just another piece to add for making infinite mana without Golem Foundry,
but it also
is more vulnerable compared to the three-mana artifact since it's a creature with a mediocre body. It will probably
be somewhat
playable if the meta will shift towards more linear decks, without lots of removal or burn spells; in all other
cases, i think that
this artifact is not worth a spot in this list.

- **Dross Skullbomb / Conjurer's Bauble**

These cards has all the cons of Blood Fountains, except one cons that they are colorless, so can be tutor with
Ancient Stirrings:
to me, this peculiarity is not enough to secure a slot in the list. Conjurer's Bauble has also the cons to be a ready
to sacrifice
artifact, that is good with Fangren Marauder, but again to me it doesn't make the cut, since except for this fringe
spot, it's
not a very good card in generale (we're not playing Eggs Tron).

- **Bitter Reunion**

This card is somehow similar to Makeshift Munitions in closing the game on the spot, and it also more usefull if
drawn before
comboing off, since lets you grant a card for a cost of a spare land or a bad card in hand. However, this card has
the same cons of
Munitions: it requires the assemble of 4 cards + him + color source, and still lose to fog lock, which are one of the
thing
than munitions tries to beat.

- **Impact Tremors / Reckless Fireweaver**

These cards where my primary choice when i tested the deck on MTGO, since are very good to close the game time is a
constraint:
they are a good choice since doesn't require a Golem Foundry, because they also win with Ashnod + 2 Myr Retriever. I
like the most
the creature, because it can be seen as a 5th Golem Foundry, that it's good also on his own, grinding life points for
every artifact
that enters the battlefield, despite the fact that can be taken down by a removal spell. On MTGO i play the Reckless
instead of one
Weather the Storm, but in paper where time is not a limit, i dropped it since the green storm istant is better in
more spots,
and it also can be evaluated as a wincon against a lot of the field; also, it open up a slot in the sideboard.

## Sideboard

![The sideboard](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FsLrhQZWcAMHETR?format=jpg&name=large)

- **Anti Graveyard Hate**

> 1 Ancient Grudge 1 Masked Vandal

These cards are used for the only purpose of removing Relic of Progenitus/Nihil Spellbomb of our opponents: the first
spell can hit double relic, and the second one can be tutored from Myr Retriever.

- **Anti linear strategies**

> 3 Duress

We can't do much against linear strategies such as Hexproof, Tribe, Cycle Storm etc., and each archetype might require
ad hoc solutions: in order to have room for other more themed card, we figure out that Duress be sideboarded in vs. all
this deck, making it a flexible ok cards versus lots of strategies that might.

- **Anti Swarm**

> 2 Breath Weapon

Good vs all the decks that tries to swarm the board in the early turns, preferred to Krark-Clan Shaman since can hit
flying creatures and does not require artifacts to sac.

- **Lifegain**

> 3 Fangren Marauder 1 Weather the Storm

The main purpose of this cards is to help us survive the early-mid game against too aggressive strategies, such as MonoR
Kuldotha or Boros: Fangren is also a solid plan B when we take out the combo and the gameplan shift on a more grindy and
midrangish build based on the green monsters and Golem Foundry.

- **Combo support**

> 1 Makeshift Munitions

Combo piece that are brought in when we need to win in the same turn of the combo: it also has some minor utility
against faeries decks (the main one is to take a counter) and is an out vs. other Fangren Marauders or other annoying
creatures. Preferred to Reckless Fireweaver or Impact Tremors for its flexibility.

- **Utils**

> 2 Smash to Dust 1 Nihil Spellbomb

Smash to Dust is a premium card that is strong for his flexibility: can remove a Relic of Progenitus, can wrath a board
of small creatures, and has the secret ability that is valuable against Defenders Combo. The black spellbomb is also an
utility can be used against annoying graveyard interactions.

### Bonus: Single card discussion:

- **Krark-Clan Shaman**

  The red goblin is a stellar sideboard card against specific decks, but it needs some requirements that this deck
  cannot offer consistently: multiple times the creature were only a 1/1 without ability, since i wasn't able to
  sacrifice enough artifacts to make it work. I prefer a Pyroclasm effect since in this build because in my opinion is a
  more solid choice, that can be also used to reach for flying creatures.


- **Scattershot**

  This is not the deck for Scattershot: in specific spot is a catch all against the Spellstutter Sprite deck, but in
  most of the other cases, is a way worse Breath Weapon. Has some synergy combined with Deadly Dispute, that enable
  multiple spell in the same turn, but which card is not good paired with the black istant?


- **Nature's Claim**

  As hate for enchantment/artifact, we preferred Masked Vandal, since is tutorable; the green istant is faster, has
  less requirements and can be used in some fringe plays to gain life, but we evaluate more the ability to fetch for an
  hate card with Myr Kinsmith, that in most of the matchup that we side in the changeling creature, we keep the 3ofs of
  the Myr.


- **Impact Tremors/ Reckless Fireweaver**

  These cards contends the spot for the combo utility for the kill in the same turn, and we ended up in choosing the
  enchant since is more flexible and, while in combo, can resolve some annoying creatures, and in general is a more
  powerful cards.


- **Crimson Acolyte**

  In multiple brainstorming session, we evaluate the white cleric as a solid way to contrast MonoR, but the creature has
  some problems: it takes too many sideboard slots, it's offcolor, and sometimes the red deck win despite the presence
  of absence of the protected creature. So in the end, we chose to resign to destiny and cut the girl.

### Match up ranking visual view:

![Ranking](./../assets/images/altar_tron_matchup.png)

This ranking may vary according to sideboard choices, player skill and overall luck.
This chart is the result of my experience with the deck, so this ranking might not totally adhere with the reality
of the meta and might be biased towards personal assumptions.

## Tournament:

I'm doing a quick coverage of the games, highlight only interesting games.
Swiss: 8-1-1
Match up:

1. Dimir Terror 2-0
   Won first match on the back of double Myr Retriever that chumpblock their 5/5s and then i eventually close the game
   comboing off,
   second game thanks to Duress i resolved a Golem Foundry that put the game in midrange mode; in the early turn
   opponent skips
   some land drop, so it was an easy battle.
2. Hexproof 2-0
   Lost the dice but i managed to go infinite life against his strong opening that will beat me one turn later: g2 was
   fast but my opponent
   kept a 'slower' t5 hand, and i managed to t4 him on the back of infinite golem despite being on the draw.
3. Affinity 2-1
   G1 I combo off creating an infamous number of 3/3, but my opponent went to the double Galvanic Blast route +
   Makeshift Munitions for the kill.
   G2 G3 went in a similar way, were i comboed off after some long Fangren Marauder grind.
4. Boros Synth 2-1
   G1 I won effortless thanks to Weather the Storm, G2 he wrecked me with a very fast start, G3 he kept a strange one
   lander hand where
   he starts with Ancient Den Glint Hawk go otp, t2 Relic of Progenitus with no land and he skips some land drop.
5. MonoR Kuldotha 2-1
   G1 i steal the game with a very lucky draw where i gained infinite life gain on t4. G2 he overwhelm me with burn, G3
   i saw lots of sideboard card and i won on the back of Fangren Marauder.
6. MonoU 2-1
   Lost to two Spell Pierce on early turn and a massive combats of Faeries and Ninjas sonn after. G2 G3 I won thanks to
   Golem Foundry, Fangren Marauder and Weather the Storm.

7. MonoU 2-0
   G1 won thanks to Golem Foundry, G2 thanks of a well timely Breath Weapon. This match had some controversies since a
   judge was evoked in the winning turn, since
   i made two land drops, that was entirely my fault. The judge call was made since i played early on a Urza's land, and
   after lots of game actions i played a Crystal Grotto,
   which made me scry 1 to the bottom. My opponent correctly call the judge, and we explained to him the situation, and
   after a quick conversation with the Head judge, he made
   rewind the action (so no land in play and the card on bottom goes on top), granting me a warning. In that spot, i
   sacrifice my Retriever for Expedition Map, fetch the cycle land,
   and with that draw hit Weather the Storm, a 2 out of 30ish card winning card. The controversy arise because inbetween
   my losing position and the winning position a referee judgment
   were stated, so the outcome might be interpreted as biased towards the judge decision.

8. Affinity 2-0
   I went for the combo both g1 and g2, and despite a Negate from my opponent in the post sideboard game, i was able to
   win without particular effort.

9. Walls Combo 0-2
   I was 8-0 but my opponent was 7-0-1, so he needed to play: Defender Combo is one of my worst match-up, and despite my
   opponent's deck was builded strangely (he was playing Vent Sentinel as wincon), he wrecked me in both games.

10. RB Madness
    We were at table 2, and an intentionally draw was summoned.

11. Top8: MonoBlack Khalni Control
    I punted game1 where i failed to draw the Weather the Storm for infinite life, and i only had an infinite army of
    golems, but he had a 4/4 Crypt Rats evoked off Initiative final room, so my Golem abruptly dies each turn thanks to
    a rat activation; In the end i was trampled to death by his Avenging Hunter. Game 2 he mull to 5 so i was able to
    quickly have access to the combo and we skyrocket to g3, where i was able to take the game thanks to Makeshift
    Munitions. In the last game, my opponent made a mistake, casting Deglamer on my Ashnod's Altar and not on my red
    enchant, and i was able to Deadly Dispute the artifact and returning it to my hand thanks to a timely sacrifice of
    Myr Retriever: if he targeted Munitions, i would had surely some trouble. In his defense, it was 1 am o'clock, this
    is was his first mistake in all the interactions we had in the games we played. Mistakes happen :)
12. Top4: Boros Synth
    We split top4 and Diego let me play the final since he had to return home (an 8 hours trip he said), so he kindly
    gave me the opportunity to battle for the title. Thanks a lot, Diego!
13. Top2: Fog Tron @AAdeptoTerra
    Like in fairy tales, i faced my friend and testing companion Alessandro, with his take on Flicker Tron; the final
    was a remake of Paupergeddon 2020, where he was gentle enought to conceded to me for making Atogshift the winning
    deck; He surely was thirsty of revenge, so this time he wanted to battle. G1 i combo but he fog multiple turns until
    he managed to combo thanks to 3 Urza's Tower + Weather the Storm + Ghostly Flicker + Memnonic Wall + Rolling
    Thunder (on of the Tronest thing i've ever seen). G2 and G3 i was able to cast multiple Duress, removing key pieces
    from his hands and graveyard also thanks to Nihil Spellbomb, and also thanks to his mull to 5 on g3, i was declared
    Paupergeddon 2023 champion. Evvai! :)

## Last words:

I had good luck all over the tournament, were i played my outs and they happen (expecially vs. Hexproof, Burn and
MonoU): i'm not Phil Hellmuth, so if luck weren't a factor, i would lost everytime.
The deck is a blast to play: it remembers my the old Krark-Clan Ironworks time, and despite the fact that the power
leve is lower, i enjoyed every game i played with this deck, also the one i lost.
As for the list, i'm quite confident that the maindeck is optimized: there is some arguments about Ichor Wellspring as a
cuttable card, since is the worst t2 play and the first card to side out, but as i said, it has a very good synergy with
Deadly Dispute, and I personally don't suggest to play without it.
Since the vast majority of my game were won on the back of Weather the Storm, i would suggest adding the fourth to the
maindeck, but i really don't know which card to trim, and i fear that the fourth copy will weaken too much the deck
against strategies that don't relies on life, that are already the worst match up for the deck.
Sideboard was specifically designed for Paupergeddon, so i won't be surprised to see completely new cards added or
removed in order to adapting it to local metagame: my suggestion is to not overplay too much out of color cards (for
example, Captured Sunlight), since the deck can't reliably afford to have much colored mana in multiple spots.
