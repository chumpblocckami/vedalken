## Introduction 
Paupergeddon Lecco which took place 26 March 2023 was the biggest Pauper Tournament ever registered, with 600+ players 
from all over Europe attending the event; the day featured 10 round of swiss, which started at 9.30 AM and continued until
22 PM, when top8 was announced.
I was good and lucky enought to be the last man standing, completed the swiss with a record of 8-1-1, and declared the winner
after another 3 winnings in the top8. For clarity, we split top4 (prizes after splitting where 1.3k in MKM coupon, 3 Secret Lairs and some goodies)
but we decide to play for the declaring the winner.
