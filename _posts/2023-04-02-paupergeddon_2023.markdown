## Introduction

Paupergeddon Lecco, which took place 26 March 2023, was the biggest Pauper
Tournament ever registered, counting 600+ players from all over Europe; the tournament, which took place at Palataurus,
featured a 10 round swiss with a
top8 cut. The event started at 9.30 AM, the swiss finished approximately at 11 PM
and the last card in the final was slinged at 2 AM. I was good and lucky enough to be the
last man standing, completing the swiss with a record of 8-1-1, and winning the 3 rounds of the top8. For clarity, we
split top4 (prizes after splitting where
something near 1.3k in MKM coupon, 3 Secret Lairs and some goodies) but we decide to
play to declare the winner. In this brief blogpost, I’ll cover some points about the deck I
played, Altar Tron, including deck building choices, match up analysis, sideboard
strategies, and then I’ll quickly describe how the tournament rolled out, which archetypes I
faced and how the games unveiled throughout the tournament.

## History

The Altar Tron archetype made is timid debut right
after [the unified pauper announcement](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/pauper-comes-paper-2019-06-27),
where paper common and MTGO common where
made playable for both the play modes, making one large shared card pool.
The new additions, such as Ashnod's Altar, ignite some interest in the combo deckbuilding community, but it took some
time and MTGO tix to actually make the deck work.
The idea of the deck is simple: deploy a large amount of 3/3 golems from Golem Foundry thanks to the big amount of
triggers made possible from 2 Myr Retriever and Ashnod's Altar.
The first approaches get ideas from another combo Tron builds, Eggs Tron, which also play a combo plan with Golem
Foundry, but it differs from the strategy; the first lists were based on midrange strategies, where the goal was to
survive and draw as many cards as possible.
In this early stage of development, two players stands among others for their
brews: [saidin raken](https://twitter.com/jakeals), who tirelessly tried the deck on MTGO, and Giorgio Venditti, aka
GiorgioCombo, a player from Italy that had great success with the deck in national paper tournament.
The lists relied heavily on Fangren Marauder or Mystical Teachings package, and they went for the midrange/control
journey for assembling the combo: at that time, the meta were slower, and only 4 copies of the myr were available,
making the combo not particularly fast, so the strategy was based around drawing cards and survive thanks to
Weather the Storm and Fangren Marauder, since the deck features lots of cheap and expendable artifacts.
After finding GiorgioCombo decklist, I played his sixties with moderate success, letting me put a
Top16 Paupergeddon Pisa result with a [list](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/4930842) that featured the afromentioned
strategy. From there, nothing really has changed, and the new lists that on and off appears online were no different in
the core but different from the support cards, ranging from less or more card draw, more or less utilities or specific
metagame
choices. The turning point for the archetype starts with the spoiler
of [Myr Kinsmith](https://scryfall.com/card/one/236/myr-kinsmith), a card that at first sight didn't say much, since
it's
a highly cost tutor for a very specific tribe that don't have much fortune in Pauper, but it quickly became another key
piece of the deck, since it has the ability to tutor Myr Retriever, which is the pillar of the combo, making the
deck faster. With this new addition, Altar Tron can drop the midrangy strat of drawing cards for eventually assemble the
combo,
and start to have a more combo-oriented settings: its focus was shifted from '**survive as long as possible**'
to '**kill as fast as possible**'

## Main

As introduced before, my deck’s choice was Altar Tron, which is a combo deck, based on
the infamous Urza Lands that features Ashnod’s Altar + Myr Retriever synergy to make a
large amount of artifacts etb triggers, a tremendously high storm count, an infinite amount
of death triggers and so on. I chose this deck because I really like combo builds (if you
want to play Aggro, play Heartstone) and I love artifacts. I also
thought that the deck was a meta sleeper, since on MTGO it does not see much play, because platform's
time constraints and in-game click intensity.

I choose to build the deck based on few, well-defined pillars:

1. _The build must be combo-centric_: I was sure that the midrange strategy of the deck wasn't optimized, and also it
   wasn't
   particularly good, so I tried to create a deck that was entirely on the combo train (example:. Myr Kinsmith >
   Mystical Teachings);


2. _Play cards that are good despite opponent's deck or turn drawn_: I opted to play cards that are weaker in power but
   are good every time they are drawn and are ok in every circumstance than spells that has more raw power but
   shines only in fringe spots (example: Ancient Stirrings > Faithless Loothing ). This choice was made since I wanted a
   deck that might survive the long run instead of a list with the purpose of spiking;


3. _Do not try to beat sideboard strategy maindeck_: I opted to not include cards in the main that are good vs.
   strategies that often
   come in after sideboard (es. graveyard hate), both for having leaner draws and also relax the deckbuilding
   decisions (example: Ichor Wellspring > Blood Fountain). If opponent is smart enough to make specific metagame calls
   in the maindeck, let be it, let's play G2 and G3 then.


4. _Minimize the use of colored cards maindeck_: The combo is almost colorless, so the baseline of the deck has to be at
   most colorelss:
   support card that are colored have to be too good to not be included. (example: Deadly Dispute > Scrapwork Mutt >
   Reckoner's Bargain)


5. _Tron lands have to be 8th or 9th edition_: BASED. (example: old layout Tron lands are not elegant);


6. _Don't try to win against every archetype and normalize losing, but always have a plan_: for this part I'll borrow
   the words from a Bryant Cook tweets, that sum ups perfectly my thoughts:
   ![Can't beat anything](./../assets/images/cant_beat_anythin.jpeg)

With the aforementioned statements in mind, let's see the decklist my testing team and I came up with:
![The Main](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FsLrghCWAAAM94t?format=jpg&name=large)

Below a brief description of cards choices:

**Combo part**:

> 4 Myr Retriever 4 Ashnod's Altar

Here we have the combo package of the deck: since the deck aims to find all the combo pieces as fast as possible, it
features
the full set of everything. There are few arguments about the fourth Altar, but after extensive testing I realized that
the Ashnod's
artifact is way more useful than any other spot card (such as Weather the Storm, Makeshift Munitions, Blood
Fountain...), so I went for the fourth copy, and never regretted it.

**Finisher**:

> 3 Weather the Storm 4 Golem Foundry

The wincons are an endless army of 3/3 golem or infinite life: this lets us close the game against the 95% of the meta,
because the vast majority of the decks played in Pauper win by combat, so an unlimited amount of blockers
and a lot of
lifepoints
are enough to win on the turn after comboing off.
In these settings, there's no same-turn finisher cards such as Makeshift Munitions or Impact Tremors, since the decks
that survives to the aforementioned combos are few and not so popular (at time of writing).

**Draw**:

> 4 Deadly Dispute 3 Ichor Wellspring

As draw engine we have the well known synergy between Ichor Wellspring and Deadly Dispute, that, as for now, is the best
way to draw cards in Pauper. In early lists, I didn't play this draw engine, but I relied on Scrapyard Mutt and
Clockwork
Fox, that were better combined with Ashnod's Altar, but weaker on their own. I quickly changed my mind since I realized
that
there's no better alternative than the infamous 'Ancestral Recall' duo.

**Tutors**:

> 4 Expedition Map 4 Ancient Stirrings 3 Myr Kinsmith

These cards make the deck very consistent, allowing a fast tron assemble and multiple ways to find combo pieces.
I consider these cards as the core of the deck, making it so powerfull.

**Support**:

> 4 Chromatic Star 4 Chromatic Sphere 2 Energy Refractor

These cards help filter mana in order to play colored spells; When I was deckbuilding the deck, I started with
only 8 chromatic artifact, but I quickly realized that at least 10 ways to make colored mana were mandatory, so i
finally
added 2 Energy Refractor for
making the access of mana of any color more consistent.

**Lands**:

> 4 Urza's Tower 4 Urza's Power Plant 4 Urza's Mine 2 Crystal Grotto 1 Forest

This is as straight as it appears: 12 Urzalands, 2 Crystal Grotto for mana of any color and a single basic in order to
fight a
possible Cleasing Wildfire.

**Utility Lands**:

> 1 Haunted Fengraf 1 Polluted Mire

These are lands that are tutored using Expedition Map when Tron is assembled and Crystal Grotto is already fetched:
Polluted Mire is great for cycling a card off the map, and the fengraf is literally a tutorable spell that lets you make
value off a creature in the graveyard and also helps deal graveyard hate at instant speed.

As for the maindeck, I think that there's no room for improving: the slots for adding new cards are very tight if not
existent, since all the pieces are well combined one another, and removing a single card will weaken others or also the
entire strategies. The idea of the deck is to have cards that are good in any moment of the game: from turn1 to turn10,
the average power of each card has to be maxed, so I preferred to avoid spike cards that are good only in certain match
up
or in certain spot.

### Bonus: Single card discussion:

- **Crop Rotation**

In preliminary drafts I played 2 copies of Crop Rotation instead of Energy Refractor, but I quickly realize that mana of
any color
was too important; the green instant was great in assembling tron, but after that it becomes weaker, despite its good
synergy
with Haunted Fengranf. I thought about cutting Map or Stirrings for Crop, since they aim to the same kind of purpose,
but Expedition Map is easier
to cast,
better in late game since it can tutor up better things, and it also enables the strongest starting hand with less
cards (
two different tron lands + map vs two different tron lands + crop + green source).
Ancient Stirrings shines in fetching the land trio and also in looking for combo pieces, so in every theoretical games I
brainstormed the green sorcery was better than the instant counterpart.
At the end, choices were made, also based on pros and cons are depicted in table:

|                           | Expedition Map | Crop Rotation         | Ancient Stirrings |
---------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Deckbuilding requirements | -              | at least 18 lands     | -                 |
| Casting                   | -              | Colored mana          | Colored Mana      |
| Best scenario             | 2 urza's       | 2 urza's, land, color | Colorless in top5 |
| Happy to play it          | 1-7 turns      | 1-3 turns             | 1-end of game     |

- **Makeshift Munitions**

In early draft, I played Makeshift Munitions as a 1 ofs for being able to win on the spot vs. decks that fog locks or
list that can burn you out to death if you assemble the infinite golem combo instead of infinite life. I quickly
realized
that
lots of my victory didn't depend on munitions, so I cut it in favor of other cards that fit better in the strategy,
defining
the red enchantment as a sidebord card. This choice was strengthen by the fact that the list doesn't feature the full
set
of
Ichor Wellspring, which
has a good synergy with it, and the fact that in this type of deck, the only role it fits is the finisher one, since the
midrange plan is
dropped, so action like sacrifice a myr with munitions to make a point of damage and returning another retriever
won't happen often,
since in that spot you likely to have comboed off. Makeshift Munitions as a card doesn't shine vs. faeries or other
decks with small
creature,
since the
primary function of our artifact is to filter color, and not being launched to opponent's creatures.

- **Blood Fountain**

From the day1, I've not been a fan of the black artifact, since it requires a lot of effort and a very specific game
moment to make it good: most of the time, it's a 1B cards that discards one and draw one, and that's not very appealing.
In the previous
build, where the plan was to be the value/midrange deck, the one mana artifact was a nice addition, but in this specific
build
it can be replaced with more impactful card, such as the third copy of Myr Kinsmith. Responding to the argument that is
a good way to beat graveyard hate g1, it's true, but Haunted Fengranf fits this role better, since it takes a land slot
which is
open, and it's tutorable with
Expedition Map, making the small artifact a better drawn in later turns. Responding to the argument that Blood Fountain
can draw you the deck combined with Energy Refractor and Golem Foundry when comboing off, it's true, but this scenario
is very unlikely:
this build runs
only two copies of the filter artifact, and also having all the 7 pieces to draw the deck and kill
is very hard and improbable. In a build with the full set of Energy Refractor, Makeshift Munitions and full set of all
the
combo pieces, can be a good addition, but good luck fit everything in a 60 cards deck.

- **Faithless Looting**

Faithless Loothing is just the worst version of Ancient Stirrings: the discard clause is very bad for the archetype,
since
it hasn't a relevant number of cards that are better in the graveyard than in hand, and also with a low land count
you'll
probably
find yourself discarding spell that somehow you want to cast in later turns. In previous build with Mystical Teachings
or Conjurer's
Bauble,
there was a weak argument in playing some copies of this spell, but it's hard to justify a slot for this card in recent
and updated
builds.

- **Reckoner's Bargain**

Reckoner's Bargain would take the 5-6th slots of Deadly Dispute, but more sacrifice clauses require more cheap
artifacts to bin,
and more black spells requires more fixing or dedicated mana sources: stated all these requirements, to me is not
optimal
to play
a weaker version of Deadly Dispute that also requires some other structural fixes, so I'll end up cutting the black
draw engine.

- **Foundry Inspector**

This card doesn't fit well in the deck since it does not add density or depth to the build, since it doesn't solve a
particular problem
that the
deck is facing or others similar issues: it's just another piece to add for making infinite mana without Golem Foundry,
but it is also more vulnerable compared to the three-mana artifact since it's a creature with a mediocre body. It will
probably
be somewhat
playable if the meta will shift towards more linear decks without lots of removal or burn spells; in all other
cases, I think that
this artifact is not worth a spot in the list.

- **Dross Skullbomb / Conjurer's Bauble**

These cards all have the cons of Blood Fountains, except one pro that they are colorless, so they can be tutored with
Ancient Stirrings:
to me, this peculiarity is not enough to secure them a slot in the list. Conjurer's Bauble has also the cons to be
a ready-to-sacrifice
artifact, that is good with Fangren Marauder, but again to me it doesn't make the cut, since except for this fringe
spot, it's
not a very good card in general (we're not playing Eggs Tron).

- **Bitter Reunion**

This card is somehow similar to Makeshift Munitions in closing the game on the spot, and it also more useful if
drawn before
comboing off, since lets you grant a card for a cost of a spare land or a bad card (but this list doesn't have any)  in
hand. However, this card has
the same cons of
Makeshift Munitions: it requires the assembly of 4 cards + it + a color source, and still lose to fog lock, which are
one of the
thing
than the other option tries to beat.

- **Impact Tremors / Reckless Fireweaver**

These cards where my primary choice when I tested the deck on MTGO, since they are very good for closing the game under
time
constraints:
they are a good choice becuase they don't require a Golem Foundry, and lets you comboing off with Ashnod's Altar + 2 Myr
Retriever. I
like
the creature the most, since it can be seen as a 5th Golem Foundry, and it's also good on his own, grinding life points
for
every artifact
that enters the battlefield; Its downside is the fact that can be taken down by a removal spell and doesn't have a very
relevant body. On MTGO I play the Reckless
instead of one
Weather the Storm, but in paper where time is not a limit, I dropped it since the green storm instant is better in
more spots,
and it also can be evaluated as a wincon against a lot of the field and also, it opens up a slot in the sideboard.

## Sideboard

![The sideboard](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FsLrhQZWcAMHETR?format=jpg&name=large)

- **Anti Graveyard Hate**

> 1 Ancient Grudge 1 Masked Vandal

These cards are used for the only purpose of removing Relic of Progenitus/Nihil Spellbomb of our opponents: the first
spell can hit double relic, and the second one can be tutored by Myr Kinsmith.

- **Anti linear strategies**

> 3 Duress

We can't do much against linear strategies such as Hexproof, Tribe, Cycle Storm etc., and each archetype requires
ad hoc solutions: in order to have room for other more themed card, we figure out that the black sorcery might be the
'catch all' card that vs. all this type of strategies. It also has the upside to reveal hidden information that might
become handy during later turns.

- **Anti Swarm**

> 2 Breath Weapon

Good vs all the decks that tries to swarm the board in the early turns, preferred to Krark-Clan Shaman since can hit
flying creatures and does not require artifacts to sac.

- **Lifegain**

> 3 Fangren Marauder 1 Weather the Storm

The main purpose of these cards are to help us survive the early-mid game against too aggressive strategies, such as
MonoR
Kuldotha or Boros: Fangren is also a solid plan B when we take out the combo, resulting in a gameplan shift, making the
build more grindy and
midrangish, mainly based on the green monsters and Golem Foundry.

- **Combo support**

> 1 Makeshift Munitions

Combo piece that are brought in when we need to win in the same turn of the combo: it also has some minor utility
against faeries decks (the main one is to take a counter) and is an out vs. other Fangren Marauders or other annoying
creatures. Preferred to Reckless Fireweaver or Impact Tremors for its flexibility.

- **Utils**

> 2 Smash to Dust 1 Nihil Spellbomb

Smash to Dust is a premium card that is strong for his flexibility: can remove a Relic of Progenitus, can wrath a board
of small creatures, and has the secret ability that is valuable against Defenders Combo. The black spellbomb is also a
utility can be used against annoying graveyard interactions.

### Bonus: Single card discussion:

- **Krark-Clan Shaman**

  The red goblin is a stellar sideboard card against specific decks, but it needs some requirements that this deck
  cannot offer consistently: multiple times the creature was only a 1/1 without ability, since I wasn't able to
  sacrifice enough artifacts to make it work. I prefer a Pyroclasm effect in this build because, in my opinion, is a
  more solid choice, that can be also used to reach for flying creatures.


- **Scattershot**

  This is not the deck for Scattershot: in specific spot is a 'catch all' against Spellstutter Sprite deck, but in
  most of the other scenarios, is a way worse Breath Weapon. Has some synergy combined with Deadly Dispute, that enable
  multiple spell in the same turn, but which card is not good paired with the black instant?


- **Nature's Claim**

  As hate for enchantment/artifact, we preferred Masked Vandal, since is tutorable; the green instant is faster, has
  fewer requirements and can be used in some fringe plays to gain life, but we evaluate more the ability to be fetched
  with Myr Kinsmith.


- **Impact Tremors/ Reckless Fireweaver**

  These cards contend the spot for the combo utility for the kill in the same turn, and we ended up in choosing
  Makeshift Munitions since is more flexible and, while in combo, can resolve some annoying creatures, and in general is
  a more
  powerful cards.


- **Crimson Acolyte**

  In multiple brainstorming session, we evaluate the white cleric as a solid way to contrast MonoR, but the creature has
  some problems: it takes too many sideboard slots, it's offcolor, and sometimes the red deck win despite the presence
  of the protected creature. So in the end, we chose to resign to our destiny and cut the girl.

### Very bonus: Sideboard strategy

This is by no mean a complete or perfect sideboard list, but for the most part, is the best line my testing team and I
figured out after playing the deck. We cluster the match up in few big categories, and then we apply some strategies
based on that. The categorization is:

1. **Full combo plan**

   This plan is used against all the linear decks, where we need to optimize the combo in order to win as fast as
   possible. Since the vast majority of these decks don't run any type of interaction, no hate card are brought in, and
   generic and cheap interaction spell are preferred (example: vs. Hexproof no Ancient Grudge vs. Relic of Progenitus,
   but 3 ofs Duress are brought in). In these match ups, time is the main actor, so the cuttable card are non-combo
   cards that are 'slower', and the only cards that are eligible are Ichor Wellspring / Energy Refractor / Deadly
   Dispute; we found out that it's better to t2 Duress this type of decks rather than net a card with Ichor Wellspring.
   It seems odd, but any other cards in the list has a higher function or are optimized for the combo.

2. **Hybrid combo plan**

   This plan is used against midrange decks that runs tons of hate cards from the sidebord: the strategy is to trim some
   combo cards, like Ashnod's Altar or Golem Foundry, in order to bring in other support cards that fits well vs. the
   deck we are facing (example: vs. Boros Fangren Marauder or Breath Weapon). This build will lead to longer matches,
   and more the game is taking, more time we have to draw combo spell, so we will eventually assemble the combo.

3. **Fangren plan**

   This plan is used against decks that runs so many hate cards that trying to finding the combo is a 'zero sum game',
   where no matter how hard we try, we won't succeed to assemble all the combo pieces. The archetypes that are so
   dominant in post sideboard games are MonoU Faeries and parent builds, and some UB Terror decklists. The main goal is
   to win on the back of Fangren Marauder and/or Golem Foundry, trying to deal against counterspells and gy hate.

4. **Control plan**

   This plan is mainly used against MonoRed Kuldotha and parent builds, where we board out the main combo pieces for
   cards that are meant to gain life and do board control. This strategy was crafted after multiple games where games
   were too fast or too deep to be cleared with the combo, so it was better to explore new route in order to get the
   win.

### Color pie overview

These are generic and long shot advices for generalize the sideboard not against specific cards or strategies, but
against colors:

| Color    | Cards in                                         | Cards out                          | Motivation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Blue     | Duress                                           | Energy Refractor Weather the Storm | The color doesnt't make much pressure: card advantage is gold,                                                                                                                      since can break the 1-to-1 that counterspells make                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Red      | Weather the Storm, Fangren Marauder              | Ichor Wellspring                   | The color is optimized for deals quick damage, but it's                                                                                                                                                                                not suited for the long run. The key is to buy time gaining life, and then try to win the late game.                                                                                                                                         |

No generic advice is stated |
| Black    | Duress                                           | Weather the Storm                  | The color doesn't have much hate cards, except from hand and land distruption. There's no good direct answer for both, so card advantage is advised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Artifact | Ancient Grudge, Smash to Dust , Fangren Marauder | -                                  | There's no decks that are full colorless, so the  main takeaways is to side in artifact removal, and side out cards that are not very good against single cards opponent can  play.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

N.B: _this is probably too generic, but before the event i did it so why not include it?_

### Match up ranking visual view:

![Ranking](./../assets/images/altar_tron_matchup.png)

This ranking may vary according to sideboard choices, player skill and overall luck.
This chart is the result of my experience with the deck, so this ranking might not totally adhere with the reality
of the meta and might be biased towards personal assumptions.

## Tournament:

I'm doing a quick coverage of the games, highlight interesting games, decisions or fact that happened: it won't be an
in-depth, step-by-step commentary since I wanted to focus on the decklist and on the overrall strategies of the deck
rather than specific matches I played; I also have the suspect that the pauper audience doesn't really care about the
descriptions of the game played written in tournaments report, but they are more happy to learn about the deck played.

**Swiss: _8-1-1_**

**Match ups:**

1. **Dimir Terror By Riccardo Cestari (my brother) 2-0**

   Won first match on the back of double Myr Retriever that chumpblock their 5/5s and then I eventually close the game
   comboing off.
   Second match, thanks to Duress, I resolved a Golem Foundry that puts the game in midrange mode; in the early turn
   opponent skip some land drop, so i was able to quickly develop my board and race it.

2. **Hexproof 2-0**

   Lost the dice but I managed to go infinite life against his strong opening that would beat me one turn later: g2 was
   fast but my opponent kept a 'slower' t5 kill hand, but despite being on the draw, I managed to t4 kill him on the
   back of infinite golem.

3. **Affinity 2-1**

   G1 I combo off creating an infamous number of 3/3, but my opponent went to the double Galvanic Blast route +
   Makeshift Munitions for the kill. G2 G3 were similar, were i comboed off after some long Fangren Marauder grind.

4. **Boros Synth by Diego Zaccagnini (top4) 2-1**

   G1 I won effortless thanks to Weather the Storm, G2 he wrecked me with a very fast start, G3 he kept a strange one
   lander hand where he starts on the draw with Ancient Den Glint Hawk go, t2 skip land drop but played Relic of
   Progenitus. The game was strange since I didn't find any colored source for some time, but this was mitigated by the
   fact that my opponent didn't draw his second lands for multiple turns; In the end I was able to cast an Ancient
   Grudge that let me combo off almost full colorless.

5. **MonoR Kuldotha by Francesco Quagliata (Elfman) 2-1**

   G1 i steal the game with a very lucky draw where I gained infinite life gain on t4; in this game i also miss t3 Tron
   assemble after playing t1 Chromatic Sphere instead of Map. G2 he overwhelms me with creatures, burn spell and again
   burn, but G3 I saw Weather the Storm early in the game and no 'dead card' (such as Golem Foundry), and then at t5 I
   resolved a Fangren Marauder; after that i was able to win thanks to the green monster and multiple golem 3/3.

6. **MonoU 2-1**

   Lost to two Spell Pierce on early turns and a massive combats of Faeries and Ninjas soon after. G2 G3 I won thanks to
   Golem Foundry, Fangren Marauder and Weather the Storm despite multiple Spell Pierce in the early turns and lots of
   sideboard from my opponent. G3 was very strange, since I was able to pair two Fangren Marauder t3 and t4, and they
   coast to coast all the game, and after multiple chumpblock by my opponent, they finally made the last bit of damage.

7. **MonoU 2-0 by Matteo Blasi (very strong player)**

   G1 won thanks to Golem Foundry, G2 thanks of a well timely Breath Weapon. This match had some controversies since a
   judge was evoked in the winning turn, becuase
   I made two land drops in one turn, and that was entirely my fault. The judge call was made after I played early on a
   Urza's land, and
   after lots of game actions I made another landrop in the form of Crystal Grotto,
   which made me scry 1 to the bottom. My opponent correctly called the judge, and we explained to him the situation,
   and he stated,
   after a quick conversation with the Head judge, to
   rewind the action (so no Crystal Grotto in play and the card on bottom goes on top), granting me a warning. In that
   spot, I then
   sacrificed Myr Retriever for a binned Expedition Map, fetched the Polluted Mire,
   and with that draw hit Weather the Storm, a 2/30ish out winning card. A small controversy arose because inbetween
   my losing position and the winning position a referee judgment
   were stated, so the outcome might be interpreted as biased towards a judge decision.

8. **Affinity by Pietro Bragioto (my father) 2-0**

   I went for the combo both g1 and g2, and despite a Negate from my opponent in the post sideboard game, i was able to
   win without particular effort.

9. **Defender Combo 0-2**

   I was 8-0 but my opponent was 7-0-1, so he needed to play: Defender Combo is one of the worst match-up for the deck,
   and despite my opponent's deck was build strangely (he was playing Vent Sentinel as wincon), he wrecked me in both
   games.

10. **RB Madness ID**

    We were at table 2, and an intentional draw was summoned. My opponent (who made Top8) was on RB Madness.

11. **Top8: MonoBlack Khalni Control 2-1**

    I punted game1 where I failed to draw the Weather the Storm for infinite life, resulting in only an infinite army of
    golems, but he had a 4/4 Crypt Rats evoked off Initiative's final room, so my Golems abruptly died each turn thanks
    to
    the rat activation; at the end I was trampled to death by his Avenging Hunter. Game 2 he mulled to **4** so I was able
    to
    quickly have access to the combo, since didn't find lots of hate cards. In the last game, my opponent made a
    mistake, casting Deglamer on my Ashnod's Altar and not on my Makeshift Munitions; I was able to sacrifice it with
    munitions and returning it to my hand thanks to a timely sacrifice of
    Myr Retriever. If he targeted Munitions, it would be a totally different game. In his defense, it was 1 am o'clock,
    and it
    was his only error in all the interactions we had in the games we played. Mistakes happen :)

12. Top4: Boros Synth by Diego Zaccagnini (the swiss one!) ID
    We split top4 and Diego let me play the final since he had to return home (an 8 hours trip he said), so he kindly
    gave me the opportunity to battle for the title. Thanks again, Diego!

13. Top2: Fog Tron by @AAdeptoTerra (my mother) 2-1
    Like in fairy tales, I faced my friend and testing companion Alessandro, with his take on Flicker Tron; the final
    was a remake of Paupergeddon 2020, where in that spot he was gentle enough to concede for making Atogshift
    the winning
    deck; he surely was thirsty of revenge, since this time he wanted to battle. G1 I went for the combo but he fogged
    multiple turns until
    he managed to combo too thanks to 3 Urza's Tower + Weather the Storm + Ghostly Flicker + Memnonic Wall + Rolling
    Thunder (one of the **Tronest** thing I've ever seen). G2 and G3 I was able to cast multiple Duress and Nihil
    Spellbomb, removing key pieces from his hands and graveyard; resulting me the Paupergeddon 2023 champion. Evvai! :)

## Last words:

I had good luck all over the tournament, were I played my outs, and they happen (expecially vs. Hexproof, Burn and
MonoU): I'm not Phil Hellmuth, so if luck weren't a factor, I would lose everytime.
The deck is a blast to play: it remembers the old Krark-Clan Ironworks time, and despite the fact that the power
level is lower, I enjoyed every game I played with the deck, also the one I lost.
As for the list, I'm quite confident that the maindeck is optimized: there is some arguments about Ichor Wellspring as a
cuttable card, since is the worst t2 play and the first card to side out, but as I previously said, it has a very good
synergy with
Deadly Dispute, and I personally don't suggest to play without it.
Since the vast majority of my game were won on the back of Weather the Storm, if i have to make a change, I would
probably suggest adding the fourth one to the
maindeck, but I really don't know which card to trim, and I fear that the fourth copy will weaken too much the deck
against strategies that don't threat the lifepoints, that are already the worst match up for the deck.
Sideboard was specifically designed for Paupergeddon, so I won't be surprised to see completely new cards added or
removed in order to adapt it to local metagame: my suggestion is to not overplay too much out of color cards (for
example, Captured Sunlight), since the deck can't reliably afford to have much colored mana in every in-game spots.

- [Stefano Fait](https://twitter.com/Gaffiere1903) for playing intermediate builds both online and on paper, confessing
  his impressions;
- [Sdraio](https://twitter.com/SSSentimiento) for sharing with me his take on the archetype, harden the concept of full
  combo builds;
- [Matteo Acqua](https://twitter.com/vapore_acqueo) for his for never ending quest to make a deck that makes golem
  better and better;
- [Symonet](https://twitter.com/wlept_) for believing in the list and actually sleeve up for the first time Tron lands;
- [Sanpop](https://twitter.com/Sanpop_mtgo) for sharing his deckbuilding ideas and sideboard plans;
- [Nicola Cordeschi](https://twitter.com/ilFrittoMtg) for being IlFritto: without him, I wouldn't probably succeed my
  third Paupergeddon: instead I would be doing some serious adult things, such as bank load or do the laundry (NO
  TIME TO PLAY)
