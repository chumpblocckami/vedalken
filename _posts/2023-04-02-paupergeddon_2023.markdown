## Introduction 
Paupergeddon Lecco which took place 26 March 2023 was the biggest Pauper Tournament ever registered, with 600+ players 
from all over Europe attending the event; the day featured 10 round of swiss, which started at 9.30 AM and continued until
22 PM, when top8 was announced.
I was good and lucky enought to be the last man standing, completed the swiss with a record of 8-1-1, and declared the winner
after another 3 winnings in the top8. For clarity, we split top4 (prizes after splitting where 1.3k in MKM coupon, 3 Secret Lairs and some goodies)
but we decide to play for the declaring the winner.
In this brief blogpost, i'll cover the deck that i played, Altar Tron, some deckbuilding choiches, match up analysis and
sideboard strategies, and then i quickly describe how the tournament rolled out, which archetypes i faced and how the games 
unveils throught the tournaments.

## The deck
![The deck](./../../../../assets/images/image.png)

The deck i played was Altar Tron, which is a combo deck, based on the infamous Urza's Land that features Ashnod's Altar + Myr Retriever 
synergy to make a large amount of artifacts etb, a tremendous number of spells casted, an infinite death triggers and so on.
I chose this deck because i really like combo decks (if you want to play Aggro, play Heartstone) and i love artifacts, and it features
both: i also thought that the deck was the sleeper of the meta, since on MTGO don't see a lots of play for time constraints and in-game
click intensity.

## Brief history
The archetype made is timid debut right after the unified pauper announcement, where paper common and mtgo common where made pauper playable
for both the play mode, making one large shared card pool: Ashnod Altar became legal, and ignite some interest in deckbuilders all over the community.
The first list were based on midrange strategies, with the aim to deploy a large amount of 3/3 golems from Goldem Foundry thanks to the big amount of 
triggers made possible from 2 Myr Retriever and Ashnod's Altar. 
Since there was only 4 copies of the myr, the combo wasn't very fast, so the strategy was based around drawing cards and survive thanks to 
Weather the Storm and Fangren Marauder, since the deck features lots of cheap, sacrifice-fooder artifacts.
Player had some moderate success with this strategy, also me, where i Top16 Paupergeddon Pisa with a [list](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/4930842) that represent the afromentioned strategy.
From there, nothing really has changed, and the new lists that on and off appears online were no different in the core but differs from the support cards,
playing more draw cards or more utilities.
The turning point for the archetype starts with the spoiler of [Myr Kinsmith](https://scryfall.com/card/one/236/myr-kinsmith), a card that a first sight don't
say much, since it's an highly cost tutor for a very specific tribe that don't have much fortune in Pauper, but it quickly became another key point of the deck,
since it has the ability to tutor Myr Retriever, which is a key part of the combo, really fasten the deck.
With this new addition, the deck can drop the midrangy strat of drawing cards for eventually assemble the combo, and start to have a more combo-oriented 
settings, where its focus was shifted from '**survive as long as possible**' to '**kill as fast as i can**'

## Philosphy
Below a brief description of card choice:

**Combo part**:

- 4 Myr Retriever 4 Ashnod's Altar
Here we have the combo package of the deck: since the deck aims to find all the combo pieces as fast as possible, it features
the full set of everyone. There are few arguments about the fourth Altar, but after extensive testing i realized that the Ashno'd 
artifact is way more useful than any other sport card, so i went for the fourth copy. 

**Finisher**: 
- 3 Weather the Storm 4 Golem Foundry
The wincon are an endless army of 3/3 golem or infinite life: this lets us close the game against the 95% of the meta, 
because the vast majority of the decks in the meta wins by combat, so an unlimited amount of blockers and a lot of lifepoints
are enough to win on the turn after comboing off; there's no same-turn finisher cards such as Makeshift Munitions or Impact Tremors, 
since the deck that can survive to this combo are few and not so popular.

**Draw**:
- 4 Deadly Dispute 3 Ichor Wellspring
As draw engine we have the well know synergy between Ichor Wellspring and Deadly Dispute, that, as for now, is the best way
to draw cards in pauper. In the early list, i didn't play this draw engine, but i relied on Scrapyard Mutt and Clockwork Fox,
that were better combined with Ashnod's Altar, but weaker on their own. I quickly changed my mind since i realized that there's no
better alternative than DD on wellspring.

**Tutors**:
**4 Expedition Map  4 Ancient Stirrings  3 Myr Kinsmith**
These cards make the deck very consistent, allowing a fast tron assemble and multiple ways to find the combo pieces. This card
are the core of the deck, and let the deck be very consistent.

**Support**:
**4 Chromatic Star  4 Chromatic Sphere 2 Energy Refractor**
These cards helps us to filter mana in order to play colored spells. I started with playing only the 8 chromatic artifact, 
but i quickly realize that i want at least 10 colored ways to make colored mana, so added 2 Energy Refractor for making 
the deck more consistent.

**Lands**:
** 4 Urza's Tower  4 Urza's Power Plant  4 Urza's Mine  2 Shimmering Grotto  1 Forest**
This is as straight as it appears: 12 Urzalands, 2 Grotto for colored mana, and a single basic for fightning a possible 
Cleasing Wildfire.

**Utility Lands**:
** 1 Haunted Fengranf  1 Polluted Mire**
These are lands that are tutored using Expedition Map when Tron is assembled and Shimmering Grotto is already fetched: Polluted 
Mire is great for cycling a card off the map, and the fengranf is literally a tutorable spell that lets you make value off a 
creature in the graveyard and also helps you fightning graveyard hate at istant speed.

## The main 
![The Main](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FsLrghCWAAAM94t?format=jpg&name=large)
As for the maindeck, i think that there's no room for improving: the slots for adding new card is very tight if not close, since
all the pieces are well combined to others, and removing a single card will weaken others or also the entire strategies.
The idea of the deck is to have cards that are good in any moment of the game: from turn1 to turn10, we need to good draws,
so i prefer to avoid spike cards that are good only in certain match up or in certain spot. With this idea in mind, the deck 
kind of build itself alone: with 17 lands, 10 cards for filtering mana, 15 cards that lets us combo, 11 tutors and 7 draw spell, 
there's no spot for other cards. We can replace some cards.

### Bonus: Single card discussion:
1. **Crop Rotation**

In the first drafts i played 2 Crop Rotation instead of Energy Refractor, but i quickly realize that the colored mana
were too important, and crop was great in assembling tron, but bad after tron was assembled, despite its good synergy with
Haunted Fengranf. I thought about cutting map for crop, since they aim to the same purpose, but Expedition Map is easier to cast,
better in late game since it can tutor up better things, and it also enable the strongest starting hand with less cards (
two different tron lands + map vs two different tron lands + crop + green source). At the end, i had to make a choice, and
assuming that i had to cut one of the tutors for crop, i analyzed proes and cons of every cards, resulting in the table:

|                           | Expedition Map| Crop Rotation | Ancient Stirrings |
---------------------------|-|-|-------------------|
| Deckbuilding requirements | - | at least 18 lands| -                 |
| Casting                   | - | Colored mana| Colored Mana      |
| Best scenario | 2 urza's | 2 urza's, land, color| Colorless in top5 |


2. **Makeshift Munitions**

In early draft, i played Makeshift Munitions as a 1 ofs for being able to win on the spot vs. decks that fog locks or decks 
that can burn you out to death if you assemble the infinite golem combo instead of infinite life. I quickly realized that 
lots of my victory didn't depend on munitions, so i cut it in favor of other cards that fits better in the strategy, and i 
add the red enchantment as a sidebord card. This choice was strenghten by the fact that i dont run the full set of Ichor, which
is in a good synergy with it, and the fact that it, in this type of deck, fit the only role of finisher, since the midrange plan is 
dropped, so action like sacrifice a myr with munitions to make a point of damage and returning another myr retriever won't happen often,
since in that spot you likely to have combo. Munitions also don't shine vs. faeries or other decks with small creature, since the
primary function of our artifact is to filter color, and not being launched to opponent's creatures. 

3. **Blood Fountain**

From the day1, i've not been a fan of the black artifact, since it requires a lot of effort and a particulary board state to make it 
good: most of the time, it's a 1B cards that discards one and draw one, and that's not very appealing. In the previous build, where
the plan was to be the value/midrange deck, the one mana artifact was a nice addition, but to me can be replaced with more impactful 
card, such as Myr Kinsmith or combo pieces. Responding to the argument that is a good way to beat graveyard hate g1, it's true, but
Haunted Fengranf fits this role better, since it take a land slot which is open, and it's tutorable with Expedition Map, makes it 
better drawn in later turns. Responding to the argument that Blood Fountain can draws you the deck combined with Energy Refractor when
comboing off, it's true, but very unlikely: i eun two copies of the filter artifact, and also with this list that is focused on 
assembling the combo as fast as it can, the full combo with Foundry is not always found, so having all the 7 pieces to draw the deck
is very hard and unlikely. In a build with the full set of Energy Refractor, Makeshift Munitions and full set of all the combo pieces,
can be a good addition, but good luck fit everything in a 60 cards deck.

4. **Faithless Looting**

Faithless Loothing is just a worst version of Ancient Stirrings: the discard clause is very bad for this build, since you
don't have a number of cards that are better in the graveyard than in hand, and also with a low land count you'll probably 
find yourself discarding spell that somehow you want to cast. In previous build with Mystical Teachings or Conjurer's Bauble, 
i can see an weak argument in playing some copies of this spell, but it's hard to justify a slot for this card. 

5. **Reckoner's Bargain**
Reckoner's Bargain is taking the 5-6th slots of Deadly Dispute, but more sacrifice clause requires more cheap artifact to sacrifice,
and more colored spell required more colored fixing/mana source: stated all this requirements, to me is not optimal to play 
a weaker version of Deadly Dispute that also requires some other structural fixes, so i'll end up cutting the black draw engine.

6. **Foundry Inspector **
This card doesn't fit well in the deck since it don't add density or depth, since don't solve a particular problem that the 
deck is facing or other similar issue, it's just another piece to add for making infinite mana without Golem Foundry, but it also
is more vulnerable compared to the three-mana artifact since it's a creature with a mediocre body. It will probably be somewhat 
playable if the meta will shift towards more linear decks, without lots of removal or burn spells; in all other cases, i think that
this artifact is not worth a spot in this list.

7. **Dross Skullbomb / Conjurer's Bauble**
These cards has all the cons of Blood Fountains, except one cons that they are colorless, so can be tutor with Ancient Stirrings:
to me, this peculiarity is not enough to secure a slot in the list. Conjurer's Bauble has also the cons to be a ready to sacrifice
artifact, that is good with Fangren Marauder, but again to me it doesn't make the cut, since except for this fringe spot, it's
not a very good card in generale (we're not playing Eggs Tron).

8. **Bitter Reunion**
This card is somehow similar to Makeshift Munitions in closing the game on the spot, and it also more usefull if drawn before 
comboing off, since lets you grant a card for a cost of a spare land or a bad card in hand. However, this card has the same cons of
Munitions: it requires the assemble of 4 cards + him + color source, and still lose to fog lock, which are one of the thing
than munitions tries to beat.

9. **Impact Tremors / Reckless Fireweaver**
These cards where my primary choice when i tested the deck on MTGO, since are very good to close the game time is a constraint:
they are a good choice since doesn't require a Golem Foundry, because they also win with Ashnod + 2 Myr Retriever. I like the most
the creature, because it can be seen as a 5th Golem Foundry, that it's good also on his own, grinding life points for every artifact
that enters the battlefield, despite the fact that can be taken down by a removal spell. On MTGO i play the Reckless instead of one 
Weather the Storm, but in paper where time is not a limit, i dropped it since the green storm istant is better in more spots, 
and it also can be evaluated as a wincon against a lot of the field; also, it open up a slot in the sideboard.
